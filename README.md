This project is a fictional time travel booking agency website developed as a **Capstone Project** for a Web Development Bootcamp (The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu). It was created to demonstrate proficiency in modern, responsive design principles and advanced CSS techniques.

## ✨ Features

ChronoPass provides a comprehensive introductory and booking experience for potential time travelers:

* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes **Bootstrap 5** for seamless viewing across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* **Memorable Guides:** Dedicated sections introducing the guide characters, Tom and Professor Moffat.
* **Customer Reviews:** A testimonial section showcasing customer experiences across different time periods (Ancient Egypt, Dinosaur Age, Year 2100).
* **Visual Memories (Carousel):** A cyclic image gallery demonstrating impressive moments from the trips.
* **Flexible Pricing:** A comparative pricing table offering three different time travel packages (`Explorer`, `Adventurer`, `Legendary`).
* **Payment Form:** A fully structured billing and payment form styled with Bootstrap for checkout.
* **Futuristic Aesthetic:** A striking, neon-themed look achieved through custom CSS and animated `@keyframes` for the background gradient.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Used for the foundational structure of the content.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling and animations (including the `.gradient-background` and `@keyframes` animations).
* **Bootstrap 5:** Employed for fast, responsive, and modern components (Navbar, Hero, Cards, Carousel, Pricing Tables, and Forms).
